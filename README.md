## Healthcare Data Analysis


This project focuses on analysing hospital records to understand the progress of common illnesses. As healthcare analysts, we have been tasked with examining trends, identifying patterns, and generating insights that can support a public health programme. The analysis aims to help in monitoring disease progression and planning effective interventions.
